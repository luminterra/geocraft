GeoCraft consists of:

  * a general purpose geoscience development platform
  * the ABAVO perspective for performing AVO analysis
  * the GeoMath perspective that contains geoscience algorithms
  * simple visualization and data exploration tools

GeoCraft is not designed to be a seismic data processing system, nor is it a replacement for seismic interpretation applications.
